Welcome to PyOffshore documentation!
===================================

**PyOffshore** is an open-source Python library to simulate offshore power plants, including:

- Fixed-bottom offshore wind farms
- Floating wind farms
- Wave energy
- Tidal energy

The objective of PyOffshore is to simulate all these technologies in stand-alone mode or in hybrid systems. PyOffshore wraps some different existing open-source tools such as PyWake, Floris, OpenFast, OpenTidal, and others.
